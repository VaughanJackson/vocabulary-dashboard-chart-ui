## Some TODOs

Remove when done.

* Weed out unnecessary dependencies/complexities introduced by first unit testing attempt.

* Develop or adopt a consistent bundling solution if such exists, so that dependencies are imported explicitly where required.
* Migrate to TypeScript.
* Integrate within an Angular or React dashboard.
